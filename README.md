CRYPTARSI is a system designed to produce, search and browse encrypted data sets. The data can be hosted on unsecured servers or locally, inside your browser local storage. The name comes from the Latin word "Crypto" and the Bulgarian word "Tarsi", meaning "search". Cryptarsi is using encrypted raw text files. There is no scripting, no RDBMS engine behind, the simpliest web server is enough to put online your searchable encrypted data.

Cryptarsi is available on Github. The old development code is found under the name "Mihalya". An early version of the system was used by the journalists from Bivol.bg while working on the Cablegate releases of Wikileaks from different locations.

The system may be useful in different fields, requiring data protection: investigative journalism, human rights activism in dictatorial countries, corporate security, etc.
